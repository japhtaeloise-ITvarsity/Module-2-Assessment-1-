                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However, the existence of up to nine extant giraffe species has been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils.</p>
                    <p>The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.</p>
                    <P>Giraffes may be preyed on by lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.The giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern, for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as vulnerable to extinction, and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves but estimates as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.</P>
                    <p>The name "giraffe" has its earliest known origins in the Arabic word zarāfah (زرافة),perhaps borrowed from the animal's Somali name geri.The Arab name is translated as "fast-walker".In early Modern English the spellings jarraf and ziraph were used, probably directly from the Arabic,and in Middle English orafle and gyrfaunt, gerfaunt. The Italian form giraffa arose in the 1590s.The modern English form developed around 1600 from the French girafe."Camelopard" /kəˈmɛləˌpɑːrd/ is an archaic English name for the giraffe; it derives from the Ancient Greek καμηλοπάρδαλις (kamēlopárdalis), from κάμηλος (kámēlos), "camel", and πάρδαλις (párdalis), "leopard", referring to its camel-like shape and leopard-like colouration.</p>
                    <p>The giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the okapi.The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described.Their closest known relatives may have been the extinct deer-like climacocerids.They, together with the family Antilocapridae (whose only extant species is the pronghorn),have been placed in the superfamily Giraffoidea.These animals may have evolved from the extinct family Palaeomerycidae which might also have been the ancestor of deer.The elongation of the neck appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage.Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest that vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down.One early giraffid ancestor was Canthumeryx which has been dated variously to have lived 25–20 million years ago (mya), 17–15 mya or 18–14.3 mya and whose deposits have been found in Libya.This animal was medium-sized, slender and antelope-like.Giraffokeryx appeared 15 mya in the Indian subcontinent and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe, and had a longer neck and similar ossicones.Giraffokeryx may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like Sivatherium and Bramatherium.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find giraffes at pen E19, right between the monkeys the and koalas.</p>
